# ### Problem 6
# Create a class called ClubMember 
# Each club member has a name and a role  
# Create ClubMember instances for the following people:
# ```
# Alfred - Club President
# Troy - Club Vice President
# Albert - Club Secretary
# Bob - Club Treasurer
# ```
# Add each member instance to a new club_members list that you create.
# Write the code needed to loop through the club member list and print the current number of members in the list, then the memberâ€™s name and club role, one per line using f strings.

# Example Output:
# ```
# There are currently 4 club members in the list!

# Club President: Alfred
# Club Vice President: Troy
# Club Secretary: Albert
# Club Treasurer: Bob
# ```
class ClubMember:
    def __init__(self, name,role):
        self.name = name
        self.role =role

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name, self.role
member1 = ClubMember("Club President", "Alfred")
member2 = ClubMember("Club Vice President", "Troy")
member3= ClubMember("Club Secretary", "Albert")
member4= ClubMember("Club Treasurer", "Bob")


memberarray= [member1,member2,member3, member4]

for member in memberarray:
    print(member.name + ":" + member.role)
